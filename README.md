# Password Generator using JavaScript
#
Module 3 Assignment

## Description
This project began by modifying starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected. This app is designed to run in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

Solving the problems of this project taught me to understand better the relationships between variables and functions in JavaScript, as well as ways to reference components of the HTML code.

WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
