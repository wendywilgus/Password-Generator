# Password Generator using JavaScript
#
Module 3 Assignment

## Description
This project began by modifying starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected. This app is designed to run in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

Solving the problems of this project taught me to understand better the relationships between variables and functions in JavaScript, as well as ways to reference components of the HTML code.
