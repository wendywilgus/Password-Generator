Pseudocoding Challenge 3

- I need to ask my user how many characters should the password be.
        -HOW do I ask that?  Is there a type of popup/prompt/etc?  Google this.


-I need the user to relog the value if the character is LESS than 8 or GREATER than 128.
        -IF <8, tell the user it must be 8 or longer
        -IF >128, tell the user it must be shorter
        
        

## If all goes well
    -I need to ask the user what kind of input you want.
        Numbers?
        Special Characters?
        Lowercase?
        Uppercase?
    -Do I need some type of STORAGE for each of these values? 
        -->IF user chooses special characters, they need to use the storage with special characters
        x 3


After grabbing whatever values/characters the user wants
--the KEY THING IS THAT THE PASSWORD VALUE IS *****RANDOMIZED***** AND IT *****MATCHES THE LENGTH***** THAT THEY USER ASKED FOR

    IS THERE anything that we learned that could theoretically know how many times the particular line of logic should run b ased on the length that the user asked for? 
    -Is there a way to RANDOMIZE the different values we pull from the STORAGES above?  ****There is a very set way to do the MATH of RANDOMIZING the values******* (This part is already written for you in the starter code.)
